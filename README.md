# Collaborative-Whiteboard
A web-based collaboration whiteboard using a backend WebSocket server and a frontend with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript. It allows multiple users to draw concurrently, where each user is assigned a random colour. Additionally, the user can also erase his drawings from the canvas which also reflects in other user's canvases.
